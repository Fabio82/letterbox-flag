# letterbox-flag
I made a siple controller that just rises the flag when mail arrives. It is mounted on a standard US mailbox and it detects the presence of mail, newspaper, other, placed inside of it with a IR sensor placed under the bottom.


I got a sharp 0A51SK 15cm distance infrared sensor info here: https://www.pololu.com/product/2450
the library for the sensor:

an arduino nano every

a letterbox

a flag (I modified the original flag and attached directly on the servo motor )

a servo motor

12V AC input from the door/bell circuit of the house

a switch that activate the circuit only when the letterbox is opened.
